*nvim-cm-swift-completer.txt* Swift completion plugin for


This plugin will add Swift completion entries to the nvim-completion-manager.
The plugin uses sourcekitten (https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten) in order
to obtain the completion entries.

Global options:                        *nvim-cm-swift-completer-global-options*

                                                         *'swift_completer_sdk'*
Type: string
Default: ''
Use this option to specify the full path to the SDK you would like to use. If
left empty, it will use the default SDK (MacOS or PC) of the system.
Example: >
    let g:swift_completer_sdk =
    '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS9.0.sdk'
<

                                                      *'swift_completer_target'*
Type: string
Default: ''
Use this option to specify the compilation target. If left empty, it will use
the default target of the system.
Examples: >
    let g:swift_completer_target = 'arm64-apple-ios9.0' " iOS
    let g:swift_completer_target = 'x86_64-apple-darwin16.6.0' " MacOS
<

                                                  *'swift_completer_spm_module'*
Type: string
Default: ''
Use this option to specify the name of a swift package manager module, in
order to let sourcekitten read the flags from it. If left empty, it will be
ignored.
WARNING! This option has not been tested yet!
Example: >
    let g:swift_completer_spm_module = 'Test'
<

Each one these options have their local equivalents:
|'b:swift_completer_sdk'|
|'b:swift_completer_target'|
|'b:swift_completer_spm_module'|
This variables take precedence over the global ones.
